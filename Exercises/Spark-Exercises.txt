# Running spark on Hortonworks sandbox - 

Start your Hortonworks virtual machine - 

# Before using Spark using Hortonworks, we need to make some configuration changes using Ambari, for this you need to login as 
  admin, which is explained as below

# First of all you need to set admin password for Ambari, to do this you need to login to virtual machine via ssh using Putty(windows) or terminal (linux or Mac)

ssh maria_dev@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
(password is maria_dev)

Once logged in, you have to login as superuser (root)

# su root
(the default password is hadoop)
Note: you will be asked to reset the default password immediately
For the sake of easeness set the password as bigdata@roma (and remember this)

Once logged in as root, you will be able to reset the ambari admin password using,

# ambari-admin-password-reset 
(At this point youâ€™ll be prompted to enter your password for the Ambari admin user)
Note: set the password as bigdata@roma for easeness and uniformity

Once the reset is done, you have to restart the ambari agent for your changes to take effect. You can do this using,
# ambari-agent restart






Go to ambari - 
http://localhost:8080/
Login: maria_dev / maria_dev
